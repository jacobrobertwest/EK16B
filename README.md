This repository contains the work-in-progress code for a short 2D top-down video game (a la The Legend of Zelda pre-N64) called "The Legend of Ellie Kemper," which contains a soundtrack that contains motifs from & loosely follows the musical progression of an album I released in 2023 called Ellie Kemper (no connection to the actress, its just a name).
